channels:
#
# This file allows you to create different conversation channels. There are 2 types of channels : 
#
# - Those protected by a permission and whose only players with this permission will be able to send/receive messages from this channel after having joined it.
#   Example : 
  'ADMIN CHANNEL':
    permission: channels.admin.access
    toggle-command: cadmin
    format: '&4&l%CHANNEL_NAME% &8| &f%PLAYER%: %MESSAGE%'
    description: '&7Channel used by admins to communicate with each other.'
    on-join: '&aYou joined the channel %CHANNEL_NAME%'
    on-quit: '&cYou left the channel %CHANNEL_NAME%'
#
#and,
#
# - Those free of access which any player can join/leave by typing the command you have chosen.
#   For example :
  'FACTION CHANNEL':
    permission: ''
    toggle-command: cfaction
    format: '&5&l%CHANNEL_NAME% &8| &f%PLAYER%: %MESSAGE%'
    description: '&7Channel to share your different tips and discuss about the Faction server.'
    on-join: '&aYou joined the channel %CHANNEL_NAME%'
    on-quit: '&cYou left the channel %CHANNEL_NAME%'
#
# Tip for pros : If you want to talk in the faction channel (for example), you can either do /cfaction to join the channel, 
# then type your message in the chat. Or (if you are a pro and want to do the two things with only one interaction). You can type
# /cfaction <your_message> and you will join the channel and your message will be sent.
#
# Moreover, notice that you can join several channels. But if you do, the only way to talk in a specific channel will be to type
# the command of this channel and your message like above.
