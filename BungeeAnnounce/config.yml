#To create scheduled messages, you must follow this pattern:
# 'name(it can be whatever you want)':
#   permission: 'your.permission' (optional, if you want that only players with that permission are able to see this announcement)
#   interval: 10 (interval between each message in seconds)
#   delay: 0 (time to wait after the plugin is loaded to begin the scheduled task in seconds)
#   message: 'message to display'
#   type: (announce/title/subtitle/action/warn)
#   servers: 
#     - 'which server the message will be display on'
#	  - 'put "all" if you want to display the message on all servers'
#
#Note: Use '[ln]' to go to the next line (works only for announce and warn messages).
#A lot of placeholders are available to be used:
#You can get them at https://github.com/Roytreo28/BungeeAnnounce/wiki/Placeholders
# 
#You can see 3 examples below ('action1', 'announce1' and 'vip1')
#You can delete/edit/copy&paste them.
